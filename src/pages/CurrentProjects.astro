						<h2 class="text-align-center">Paving the Pathway</h2>
						<p>A hub for creating surveys and interviews regarding collaboratively building awareness for the importance of implementing accessible design principles (and WCAG conformance) across all Western Washington University departments and divisions. These surveys and interviews inform faculty, staff, administration, and students of current accessibility issues at Western. The intent of these surveys is to help us best define how to systemically prioritize and fix the current accessibility issues that daunt our stakeholders. Most importantly , we focus on sustaining a thriving group of prospective graduates at Western with the promise of equitable access to all of Westerns offerrings. Student success is number 1.

						<p>The Empathy Machine is designed to be a strong motivator and instigater to empathetic humans who, by nature, tend to act on behalf of others.  The Empathy Machine project intends to help instigate and propogate the need for the improvement of automated accessibility checkers. ARL research and development projects are helping define the possibilities.

					<h2 class="text-align-center">Descriptive Alt Text Generator (DATG)</h2>
					<p>
						The DATG aims to help all alt text designers learn how to create more effective alt text with AI, and with human interaction as a supplement built into the alt text authoring process. 
						Also, It's a good time to start creating a language model for Western that Western IT can rely on for current and correct data. Multiple departments and divisions across campus need this type of access now. Not just for alt text, but a localized alt text database is a priority on our list of goals to tackle.

						the human aspect of transferring visual data from eyeball to alt text, then exploring how the subjective view of the alt text is interpreted differently than the intent of the alt text  author really intrigues me. Creating alt text is poetry! I'm sticking to it.

					<h2 class="text-align-center">Efficient Accessibility Review Tool (EART)</h2>
					<p>
						The EART allows an interested person to scrape a webpage for heading structure, alt text, and much more. It's a valuable tool for an efficient look at the basic WCAG conformance of a webpage. No WCAG  results offerred in the output of the program, but a healthy look at the components on the page.

<h2>Accessible Maps</h2>
<p>A fun group of motivated students, faculty, and staff are working on trying to help make the campus map more accessible and equitable to all.
	<ul>
		<li>Adding layers to the current map on Western webpages (gender neutral bathrooms, for example)</li>
		<li>Creating a detailed map of the Huntoon trail. Very multi-modal centric design</li>
		<li>Sound Map of Western</li>
		<li>GEOLocatable waypoints across campus</li>
		<li>Fully WCAG conformant map interface for all of Western.</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Sehome Hill Digital and Physical</h2>
<p>
	There's lots of work being done, and lots of interesting research:
	<ul>
<li>SHABOG</li>
<li>Sound Map in the Arboretum</li>
li>Huntoon Trail Accessible Map</li>
<li>Changing the Western map to reflect the change in the placement of artwork.</li>
<li>Also, we should be concerned regarding other maps that include things like buildings, parking, and other types of changes that occur on campus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>responsibleParties at Western</h3>
	<p>Who will be responsible for this new data interpolation and HR resource by April 2026 when we need to be fully WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformant across all digital technologies at Western, according to ADA Title 2 recent rule changes?
</p>
<p>
	The ARL researches how to solve these tough questions realizing there are almost never any simple solutions to tough questions. A patient and methodical approach is required for this type of research as we follow the ever changing operating systems, browsers, and assistive technologies.
</p>

<h2>Tree Tour</h2>
<p>Web Communication Technologies (WebTech) is working to replace the Western Tree Tour with a more accessible and interactive experience of exploring tree life on campus.
</p>

<h2>Commentary</h2>
<h3>Comments/Ideas?</h3>
<p> Let us know what you think we should be doing in the accessibility research lab. We're always intrigued to take on new challenges.
