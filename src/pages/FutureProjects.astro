						<h2 class="text-align-center">Accessible Drafting</h2>
						<p>3D is for more than just movies. The ARL is planning to attempt to partner with the engineering department to utilize 3D printers as input devices for computer-aided drafting programs. We’ll use haptics (technology designed around the sense of touch) and audio queues for boundary alerts so that a blind drafter can create drawings with precision. </p>

						<h2 class="text-align-center">Fully Accessible Maps</h2>
						<p>We at ARL would like to help create a fully accessible digital map of Western’s campus so that it can be navigated with greater ease and confidence of precision. Focus on multi-modal design. This project promotes student mobility, safety, and success. </p>

						<h2 class="text-align-center">Fully Accessible Virtual Tour</h2>
						<p>The ARL plans to help create a fully accessible virtual tour of campus so that all Western departments and divisions can promote the features that our campus has to offer. Multi-modal methods of communication designed in. An auto play on Youtube (or whatever is most appropriate nowadays) to help the SEO numbers.</p>

						<h2 class="text-align-center">Accessible XR</h2>
						<h3>The Arl wants to help create accessible XR for all humans.</h3>
						<p>Imagining the potential of what is to come in the future, I'm surprised to be in the position I'm in. A deep dive into moderately priced VR glasses would be a very interesting way to research how to best provide for people who are home bound to experience Mother Nature with some sort of equity.
A headset with killer audio and video experiences could enhance the haptec experience and help to shift the consumer viewpoint and consciousness to be saturated. Thereby increasing the potential of learning the material in many modes of perception all at once. Almost if you were there in person
